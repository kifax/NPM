            <p>Prominent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: "Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed" and "24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change".
                A crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.
                The debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.
                Fan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.
                Club sources told BBC Sport the protests are "hurting" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.
                Tottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.
                A 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.
                Last week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.
                Among those principles were demands to "commit to winning" with investment; "attract and retain talent" with competitive wages; "develop elite youth talent"; "lead with integrity" to be "financially sustainable" while "keeping tickets affordable"; and engage with fans.
                BBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.
                Some of the key points made were:
                Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and "every option is open" for different future ownership structures
                He is "hurt" by protests, "hurt" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide away
                An acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially
                Club leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals
                Sources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional "own goals" on policies.

            <p> From Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole to Malcolm Macdonald and Jackie Milburn, Newcastle's fans have long held a special affinity for a goalscoring striker.
                Isak may have the number 14 emblazoned on the back of his shirt, but the Sweden striker is cut from the same cloth as names typically associated with the fabled number nine.
                In the Premier League era, only two men have scored in more successive games than Isak - Shearer (15) and Cole (eight) - to underline why he will quickly establish himself as a hero on Tyneside.
                The double he scored in this one-sided victory over Spurs underlined his finishing prowess as Newcastle left the visitors dazed in the spring sunshine.
                Isak opened the scoring after he received the ball from Gordon, cut inside, then powerfully struck a low shot into corner of the net.
                The goal was the first scored since Newcastle introduced "sound shirts" which allow deaf fans to feel the noise of St James' Park.
                Newcastle captain Dan Burn used sign language to say "love the fans" during the celebrations that followed Isak's strike.
                Gordon added a second after he latched on to Pedro Porro's miscued clearance, before Isak effectively made the points safe after the interval.
                The 24-year-old initially looked to be offside when he burst through on goal, opened up his body and steered the ball past Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario.
                But Isak had timed his run, from inside his own half, to perfection before he produced an ice-cool finish.
                A hat-trick evaded Isak - Schar added a fourth with a header from a Gordon corner - but he was firmly the name on the lips of those streaming out of the Gallowgate End at the full-time whistle.
