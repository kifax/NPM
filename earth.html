           <h2>Elephants hate bees  here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers/h2>
            <img src="assets/earth.png" alt="">


            <p>
                Inspired by the tale, Vollrath and Douglas-Hamilton began working with Lucy King, co-existence director at Save the Elephants, to investigate scientifically whether bees could really scare the giant pachyderms. By 2007 their research had led them to conclude that elephants not only stay away from trees containing beehives of wild African honeybees, but "also rumble to each other to tell each other to stay away", King says. "We know that they can get stung, and we know that they never forget."
King designed a tool farmers could use to protect their crops from hungry elephants: a fence made of beehives. She first tested the idea in 2008 in a community in Laikipia, Kenya, which suffered from regular elephant crop-raids.
The fence goes all around a farm, with hives placed every 10m (33ft) between two posts. Lured in with natural attractants such as beeswax and lemongrass oil, African honeybees naturally colonise the beehives.
"For one acre [0.4 hectares] of farmland, you need 24 beehives," King says. However, just 12 of these are real: every other one is a dummy beehive â€“ a fake made of just a yellow piece of plywood that gives the elephants the illusion that there are more beehives than there really are. This reduces costs and gives more space to the bees. "As an elephant approaches in the dark, and they can smell bees, and they can smell honey, they can see a load of yellow boxes. They don't know which one is real and which one is fake. So it's an illusion. And it seems to work," King says.
Other than deterring elephants from the crops and so providing food security, the beehive fences can bring other benefits to the communities who use them.
For one thing, they can generate an additional income for the farmers by producing honey. "If a farmer has honey and has crops, it's actually good enough for the family to go on," says Mwamba, who lives in one of the villages where the beehive fences have been tested and has now become a beehive fence project officer for Save the Elephants, teaching other farmers how to build and maintain the fences.

            <h3>Electric bus trial to help reduce emissions</h3>
            <img src="assets/earth2.webp" alt="">
            <p>An electric bus will be serving some routes on the Isle of Man as part of moves to reduce carbon emissions.
                A 25-seat single-decker is set to travel through Manx towns carrying passengers until 19 April, following similar tests in 2023 and and 2024.
                A Bus Vannin spokesman said its time on the island would be spent analysing how the terrain "affects the battery technology available within this type of vehicle".
                The trial was part of a "continued evaluation of alternative fuel options and zero exhaust emissions" by the Department of Infrastructure (DOI), he said.
                The visit by the Alexander Dennis Enviro 100 has been provided for trial at no cost to Bus Vannin, the spokesman confirmed.
                He said the model, which was smaller and lighter than previous vehicles trialled on-island, had not been tested on Manx roads before.
                The all-electric vehicle is set to be driven on "as many different routes as possible during the period" and the testing would "help build a wider knowledge base for Bus Vannin to understand what options could be available" in future, he added.
                Testing in February 2023 included the vehicle carrying sandbags in place of people.
                Later that year the department ran passenger services on two buses, one single-decker and one double-decker, during the 2023 TT festival.
                In 2024, another model was tested for its suitability for the island's roads. </p>
